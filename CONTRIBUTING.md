Building the Operator
---------------------

### Requirements

- You’ll need a Kubernetes cluster to run against. You can use [KIND](https://sigs.k8s.io/kind)
- [Go](https://golang.org/doc/install) 1.20.x (for building the operator locally)
- [kuttl](https://kuttl.dev/) (for running e2e tests).
- [kubebuilder](https://book-v1.book.kubebuilder.io/getting_started/installation_and_setup.html) for developing the operator.

### Steps

Clone the repository locally.

```sh
$ git clone git@github.com:coralogix/coralogix-operator
```

Navigate to the operator directory and install it.
This command will build the operator and install the CRDs located at [crd directory](./config/crd) into the K8s cluster
specified in ~/.kube/config.

```sh
$ make install
```

Add the region and api-key as environment variables (or later as flags).

```sh
$ export CORALOGIX_API_KEY="xxx-xxx-xxx"
$ export CORALOGIX_ENV = "EUROPE2"
```

Run the operator locally
```sh
$ go run main.go
```
Or with `regin` and `api-key` flags
```sh
$ go run main.go -region EUROPE2 -api-key xxx-xxx-xxx
```

Running examples
---------------------
It's possible to use one of the samples in the [sample directory](./config/samples) or creating your own sample file.
Then apply it -

```sh
$ kubectl apply -f config/samples/alerts/standard_alert.yaml
```

Getting the resource status

```sh
$ kubectl get alerts.coralogix.com standard-alert-example -oyaml
```

Destroying the resource.

```sh
$ kubectl delete alerts.coralogix.com standard-alert-example
```

Developing
---------------------
We use [kubebuilder](https://book.kubebuilder.io/) for developing the operator.
When creating or updating CRDs remember to run 
```sh
make manifests
````

Tests
---------------------
We use [kuttl](https://kuttl.dev/) for end-to-end tests.
The test files are located at [./tests/e2e/](./tests/e2e)
In order to run the full suite of `kuttl` tests, run -
```sh
$ make e2e
````

*Note:* `kuttl` tests create real resources and in a case of failure some resources may not be removed.

Releases
---------------------
To determine the release convention we use [semantic-release](.releaserc.json) -
```sh
"releaseRules": [
          {"message": "major*", "release": "major"},
          {"message": "minor*", "release": "minor"},
          {"message": "patch*", "release": "patch"}
        ]
